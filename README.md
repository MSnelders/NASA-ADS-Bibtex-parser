# NASA-ADS-Bibtex-parser
A simple python script that will change the (not-as-useful) bib-keys generated by the ADS service into something more useful. 

Do you use the NASA ADS (Astrophysics Data System) for your papers but are you frustrated that the default keys are not exactly useful? Look no further. With some instructions in your ADS account and this script you can turn all those keys into something more useful. 

As an example, the default settings of the ADS service generates the following bibtex-entry for this article (with the **key in bold**, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020NatAs.tmp..232K/abstract):  
@ARTICLE{**2020NatAs.tmp..232K**,  
       author = {{Kirsten}, F. and {Snelders}, M.~P. and {Jenkins}, M. and {Nimmo}, K. and {van den Eijnden}, J. and {Hessels}, J.~W.~T. and {Gawro{\'n}ski}, M.~P. and {Yang}, J.},  
        title = "{Detection of two bright radio bursts from magnetar SGR 1935 + 2154}",  
      journal = {Nature Astronomy},  
     keywords = {Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena},  
         year = 2020,  
        month = nov,  
          doi = {10.1038/s41550-020-01246-3},  
archivePrefix = {arXiv},  
       eprint = {2007.05101},  
 primaryClass = {astro-ph.HE},  
       adsurl = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020NatAs.tmp..232K},  
      adsnote = {Provided by the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System}  
}  


It is actually possible to change the settings in your ADS account to generate more useful keys. To do so, go to https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/settings/application and update your "BibTeX Default Export Key Format". If this is changed to "%1H_%Y_%q" the generated keys will now be in the format of "Lastname_year_joural", e.g.:  
@ARTICLE{Kirsten_2020_NatAs,

While this is already a huge step forward it can cause some issues. First, it is now possible that multiple entries have the same key. This happens for example with:  
@ARTICLE{Chime/FrbCollaboration_2020_Natur,  
       author = {{Chime/Frb Collaboration} and {Amiri}, M. and {Andersen}, B.~C. and {Bandura}, K.~M. and {Bhardwaj}, M. ...},  
        title = "{Periodic activity from a fast radio burst source}",  
      journal = {Nature},  
         year = 2020,  
        month = jun,  
       volume = {582},  
        pages = {351-355},  
}  

and  

@ARTICLE{CHIME/FRBCollaboration_2020_Natur,  
       author = {{CHIME/FRB Collaboration} and {Andersen}, B.~C. and {Bandura}, K.~M. and {Bhardwaj}, M. and ...},  
        title = "{A bright millisecond-duration radio burst from a Galactic magnetar}",  
      journal = {Nature},  
         year = 2020,  
        month = nov,  
       volume = {587},  
        pages = {54-58},  
}
